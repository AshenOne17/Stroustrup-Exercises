# Stroustrup-Exercises

So I started reading a book named "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (PPAP)", by creator of the C++ language himself - Bjarne Stroustroup. As far as I remember, the book is in its 3rd version (C++11 and C++14). In this repo I will put all exercies, drills and practice questions from the book. As well as maybe some other stuff related to it, nothing special.
