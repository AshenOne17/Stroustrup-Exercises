# Stroustrup-Exercises
Exercies, drills and practice questions from the book "Programming: Principles and Practices using C++", by Bjarne Stroustrup. I started reading it not so long ago, and there are many things to do in practice from there, so I will simply store it all right in this repo. Organised system by **Chapters**/**Drills** | **Exercises** | **Practical questions**.
